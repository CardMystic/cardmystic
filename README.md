Magic: The Gathering is a complex and intricate game, but finding cards shouldn't be. Our developers decided that traditional keyword search engines fall short. They require exact wording and an intimate knowledge of Magic terms.

CardMystic makes card discovery effortless with natural language search. Just type what you're thinking: ‚Äúa blue creature that draws cards‚Äù or ‚Äúa cheap red burn spell‚Äù and let CardMystic handle the rest. Whether you're a seasoned deckbuilder or brand new to the game, CardMystic helps you find the perfect card without the guesswork.

This project uses Vue & Nuxt as well as the Vuetify component library.
